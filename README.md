# Simple-House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The backend is powered by Python and Flask, while the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for the backend and machine learning.
- **Flask**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests.
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning, specifically for training the linear regression model.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for creating the user interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system. You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

- `Flask`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pickle`

```

## Running the Application

### Start the Flask Server

Launch the Flask server using:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start and listen on [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

### Using the HTML Form

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/). Enter the required values into the form to get the predicted house price.
